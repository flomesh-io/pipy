## Description

Creates a pipeline layout that executes a periodic job or responds to a specified signal.

When used without an argument, the job will be started only once at startup.

When used with a number or a time-unit-suffixed string, the job will be created periodically. Valid time unit suffixes include: `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days.

When used with a signal name such as "_SIGINT_" or "_SIGHUP_", the job will be created when the signal is received by the Pipy process.

At creation, each pipeline created for a job will receive a pair of _MessageStart_ and _MessageEnd_ events as its one and only input. The pipeline should eventually output a _StreamEnd_ event to indicate the completion of the job. The next recurrence of the job, if any, will not happen until the current one is completed.

After calling this method on a _Configuration_, the newly created pipeline layout would become current. Any _filter-creating_ methods called after this point would append filters to that layout, until another _pipeline-layout-creating_ method is called.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy().task()
pipy().task(interval)
pipy().task(signal)
```

### Parameters

<Parameters/>

### Return value

<ReturnValue/>

## Example

``` js
pipy({
  _g: { counter: 0 },
})

// Start a job at startup
.task()
  .handleStreamStart(
    () => console.log('Started.')
  )

// Start a job every 5 seconds
.task('5s')
  .handleStreamStart(
    // Print 'Hello!' at the beginning of the job
    () => console.log(`Hello! Counter is ${++_g.counter}`)
  )
  .replaceMessage(
    // Indicate end of the job by outputting a StreamEnd event
    new StreamEnd
  )

// Start a job when SIGINT is received
.task('SIGINT')
  .handleStreamStart(
    // Gracefully shut down, which is also the default behaviour for SIGINT
    () => pipy.exit()
  )
  .replaceMessage(
    // Indicate end of the job by outputting a StreamEnd event
    new StreamEnd
  )
```
