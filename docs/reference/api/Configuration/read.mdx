api: Configuration.read

## Description

Creates a pipeline layout to read and process Data from a file.

The pathname of the file to read is specified in the first parameter. It can be `"-"` for reading from the standard input.

After calling this method on a _Configuration_, the newly created pipeline layout would become current. Any _filter-creating_ methods called after this point would append filters to that layout, until another _pipeline-layout-creating_ method is called.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy().read(filename)
```

### Parameters

<Parameters/>

### Return value

<ReturnValue/>

## Example

``` js
pipy()

.read('/path/to/input.txt') // Open and read from file /path/to/input.txt
  .dump() // Add filter, dump to stdout whatever is in the file
```
