api: Configuration.depositMessage()

## Description

Appends a **depositMessage** filter to the current pipeline layout.

A **depositMessage** filter buffers a whole message body in a temporary file. Its input and output are all messages.

<FilterDiagram
  name="depositMessage"
  input="Message"
  output="Message"
/>

The pathname of the output file is specified in the first parameter. It can be a string or a function that returns a string.

This filter passes down messages unaltered. It doesn't change anything in a message. It only writes the message body in a temporary file and do an asynchronous read afterwards. This is useful when combined with throttling filters (such as [throttleConcurrency()](/reference/api/Configuration/throttleConcurrency)) to control data flow for large messages.

### Option: threshold

You can set a minimum message size for the writing to kick in by the option _threshold_ in the _options_ parameter. It can be a number in bytes, or a string ending with one of the size unit suffixes, such as `"k"`, `"m"` and `"g"`. Before the message body size has reached the threshold, events are simply passed through without delay. The default threshold is zero.

### Option: keep

By default, the temporary file will be deleted after the whole message has passed completely. You can set the option _keep_ to _true_ to have the file remained.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .depositMessage(filename)

pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .depositMessage(
      () => getFilename()
    )

pipy()
  .pipeline('example')
    .depositMessage(
      () => getFilename(),
      {
        threshold,
        keep,
      }
    )
```
