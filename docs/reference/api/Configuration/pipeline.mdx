title: "Configuration.pipeline()"
api: Configuration.pipeline()

## Description

Creates a sub-pipeline layout under a specified name.

Sub-pipelines are pipelines that can be created from other pipelines during the processing of a stream. They are created by referring to their names. Pipeline layout names are unique within a module, but can be duplicated across different modules. Therefore, to refer to a pipeline layout inside the current module, only its name is necessary, but to refer to a pipeline layout in a different module (as in the case of [Configuration.use()](/reference/api/Configuration/use)), the module's filename is also needed.

After calling this method on a _Configuration_, the newly created pipeline layout would become current. Any _filter-creating_ methods called after this point would append filters to that layout, until another _pipeline-layout-creating_ method is called.

## Syntax

``` js
pipy().pipeline(name)
```

### Parameters

<Parameters/>

### Return value

<ReturnValue/>

## Example

``` js
pipy()

// Start listening on 8080
.listen(8080)
  .fork('send-and-forget') // Clone the TCP stream to a new 'send-and-forget' sub-pipeline
  .serveHTTP(
    new Message('Hello!') // Respond with a hello
  )

// Defines a sub-pipeline layout named 'send-and-forget'
.pipeline('send-and-forget')
  .connect('localhost:8000') // Send the stream to a remote host
```
