## Description

**StreamEnd** marks the end of an event stream.

The _end of a stream_ can mean a few different things depending on the situation:

- Client shutting down the connection to the server
- Server shutting down the connection to the client
- Various network errors that caused a connection to close, such as "target not reachable", "DNS resolving failure", "connection refused", "reading/writing timeout", etc.
- A runtime script error that caused a pipeline to close
- The end of a [task](/reference/api/Configuration/task) execution
