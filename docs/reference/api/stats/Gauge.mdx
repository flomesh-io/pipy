# Description

_Gauge_ is one of a few types of metrics supported by the _stats_ system. It reflects a fluctuating value that is usually sampled at a regular frequency. Once you've created one, it becomes visible to the _stats_ system, and its current value can be queried via admin port under the endpoint `GET /metrics` in [_Prometheus exposition formats_](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).

You create a _Gauge_ by a name, optionally providing label names if it has sub-metrics.

``` js
pipy({
  _gauge: new stats.Gauge('concurrency', ['peer'])
})
```

> Metric names starting with `pipy_` are reserved for internal use.

After that, you change the metric value by [`set()`](/reference/api/stats/Gauge/set).

``` js
_gauge.set(100)
```

You can also access a sub-metric by giving values to the labels. The label values must be given in the order they appear in the construction.

``` js
_gauge.withLabels('127.0.0.1').set(3)
```
