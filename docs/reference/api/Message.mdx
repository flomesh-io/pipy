## Description

**Message** is a container of a series of events that compose a whole message in an event stream.

**Message** in itself is not an event. Instead, it's a convenient wrapper of an event series including a leading [MessageStart](/reference/api/MessageStart) event, an ending [MessageEnd](/reference/api/MessageEnd) event and one or more [Data](/reference/api/Data) events in between for the message body (or payload).

When a filter callback needs a _Message_, such as [handleMessage](/reference/Configuration/handleMessage), it'll wait and collect all those events composing a full message and combine them into a _Message_ object for handling by the script. When a filter is to output a _Message_, it decomposes the object into a series of events representing the original full message.
