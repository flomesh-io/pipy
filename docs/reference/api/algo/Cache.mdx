## Description

**Cache** is an ephemeral key-value storage that automatically cleans up old entries.

There are 2 ways to fill the cache. First, you can use [set()](/reference/api/algo/Cache/set) to directly add a key-value pair to it. Second, you can provide a callback function that is called with a key and returns the corresponding value when [get()](/reference/api/algo/Cache/get) could not find an entry.
