api: algo.Cache.new

## Description

Creates an instance of **Cache**.

You can provide two optional callbacks:

- _add_ - Will be called with the key when a requested entry cannot be found and its return value will be used to fill in that entry
- _remove_ - Will be called with the key and value when an entry is about to be erased

You can set the maximum number of entries by option _size_ in the _options_ parameter. When entries are more than that number, _old_ entries will be purged on the _LRU_ (least recently used) basis.

You can also specify the TTL (time to live) for all entries by option _ttl_ in the _options_ parameter.

## Syntax

``` js
new algo.Cache()

new algo.Cache(
  (k) => getEntryValue(k)
)

new algo.Cache(
  (k) => getEntryValue(k),
  (k, v) => onRemoveEntry(k, v),
  {
    size,
    ttl,
  }
)
```
