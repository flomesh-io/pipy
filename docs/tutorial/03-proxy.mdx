title: "Part 3: Proxy"
---

We have used Pipy as a server for handling requests. Now we will be using it
the way it is mostly used for: a network proxy.

# Create a proxy program

Click the Pipy icon at top-left to go back to the Web UI homepage. Create
a new codebase named `/proxy` in the same way you've done in
[Part 1](/tutorial/01-hello#create-a-pipy-program).
Add a new file `/proxy.js` in the codebase and make it the entrance.

Don't bother with the `/hello` program we've already made. Just leave it there.
We will be using it as our upstream server for testing a while later.

The script for `/proxy.js` will be like:

``` js
pipy()

.listen(8000)
  .demuxHTTP('forward')

.pipeline('forward')
  .muxHTTP('connection')

.pipeline('connection')
  .connect('localhost:8080')
```

# Code dissection

Besides one _port pipeline_, this time we also defined two _sub-pipelines_,
namely "_forward_" and "_connection_".

1. The _port pipeline_ listens on port 8000 and contains only one
   filter **demuxHTTP**. It does the same as **serveHTTP**, but instead of
   handling HTTP requests in a _callback function_, it handles them in
   a _sub-pipeline_, which is refered to under the name "_forward_" in its
   sole construction parameter.

2. The _sub-pipeline_ named "_forward_" contains a **muxHTTP** filter.
   This filter receives messages from **demuxHTTP** as its input and in turn
   forwards them to another _sub-pipeline_ under the name "_connection_", as
   given in its construction parameter.

3. The last pipeline "_connection_" is also a _sub-pipeline_. It contains
   only one filter **connect**, which sends all its input to a remote host
   specified in its construction parameter ("_localhost:8080_") and outputs
   everything it receives from that host.

# Mux and demux

You may ask why we would bother defining 3 pipelines instead of just one like
in "_Hello World_" we have done earlier. This has to do with how a level 7
protocol works (like HTTP) compared to a level 4 protocol (like TCP).

Simply put it, on level 4 you see "_streams_" while on level 7 you see discrete
"_messages_" combined into streams.

## demuxHTTP

A _port pipeline_ swallows incoming data as a sequence of
[_Data_](/reference/classes/Data) events, each holding a small chunk of
the TCP stream. What **demuxHTTP** does is "_divide_" the TCP stream
into separate HTTP messages and then wraps each of them between
[_MessageStart_](/reference/classes/MessageStart) and
[_MessageEnd_](/reference/classes/MessageEnd) events for further processing.

Each of those messages extracted from a TCP stream should to be handled
in an independent pipeline different than **demuxHTTP**'s pipeline that works
on TCP layer. Well, you might be able to, in some extremely simplified use cases,
handle all messages in the same pipeline flowing the very stream they come from,
but in most cases, you would end up mixing states between messages and running
into erroneous logic.

That is why **demuxHTTP** was designed to send messages to a new sub-pipeline
for handling. It does this for every message it extracts from the input stream.
That means one port pipeline handling one incoming connection will be forked
at **demuxHTTP** into many sub-pipelines so that each message can be handled
separately.

## muxHTTP

In the proxy sample we are trying to do here, we need to pass all messages to
an upstream server. Before an HTTP message can be sent over network, it has
to be wrapped in a TCP stream. But we can't do this separately for every
message we are forwarding, that would end up with too many streams, which leads
to many outgoing connections.

That is where **muxHTTP** comes in handy. It combines all input messages into
one TCP stream and pumps it into the same pipeline. And that final pipeline
will establish a TCP connection to the upstream server in its **connect** filter
and transfer data back and forth.

## Pipeline topology

Let's say we have one incoming connection running 2 requests on it, to handle it
all correctly we need up to 4 inter-connected pipelines:

```
                ┌───────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
                │               │     │             │      │             │

      │         │  │         │  │     │  └───────┘  │      │             │

      ▲         │  │         │  │     │  ┌───────┐  │      │             │

      │         │  │         │  │     │  │muxHTTP│  │      │             │

                └───────────────┘     └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
                  port pipeline        sub-pipeline         sub-pipeline
                listening on 8080      "forward" x 2        "connection"
```

# Test in action

Now start the proxy program and `curl` it:

``` sh
curl localhost:8000 -i
```

You will get an error in response:

```
HTTP/1.1 502 Connection Refused
content-length: 0
connection: keep-alive
```

That's because we don't have an upstream server yet to pass requests to.

## Start a second Pipy instance

We have only one running Pipy instance now, which is already running
our proxy program. Now we need to start a second one for the test server.

1. Go back to Web UI homepage, find the `/hello` codebase you've created before,
   click on it to open.

2. Copy the URL appearing in the browser address bar.

3. Open a second terminal window, type `pipy` and paste after it the URL you
   just copied. It would be something like this:

```sh
pipy http://localhost:6060/repo/hello/
```

Now a new Pipy instance should be up and running. Curl it as eariler and
see if you'd get the correct answer.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 11
connection: keep-alive

Hi, there!
```

# Summary

In this part of tutorial, you've learned how Pipy can work as a network proxy.
You've also seen why we need _sub-pipelines_ and why they can be more than
the number of incoming connections.

## Takeaways

1. Port pipelines receives data in TCP layer. To handle individual HTTP messages,
   we need filters like **serveHTTP** or **demuxHTTP** to extract messages
   out of it.

2. The difference between **serveHTTP** and **demuxHTTP** is that, the former
   handles extracted messages by a _callback function_ while the latter handles
   them in many separate sub-pipelines.

3. Before HTTP messages are sent over network, they need to be combined into
   TCP streams with **muxHTTP**.

4. Use **connect** to establish outgoing TCP connections to remote hosts.

## What's next?

Our first try for a network proxy is over-simplified. It really does nothing
more than mapping one IP/port to another. For a proxy to be any useful, we need
functionalities like routing, load balancing, and so on. Next, we'll be looking
at one of the basic tasks a proxy can do: routing.
