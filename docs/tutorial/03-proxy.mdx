We have used Pipy as a server for handling HTTP requests. Now we will be using it as what Pipy is mostly used for: a network proxy.

## Create a proxy

Click the Pipy icon at top-left to go back to Web UI homepage. Create a new codebase named `/proxy` in the same way you've done in [Part 2](/tutorial/02-echo#create-a-pipy-codebase).

> Don't mind that `/hello` codebase we've just created. Leave it there for a moment, because we'll be using it as our upstream server a while later for testing.

Add a new file `/proxy.js` to the new codebase and make it the entrance by clicking <FlagIcon/>. The script for `/proxy.js` would be like:

``` js
pipy()

  .listen(8000)
  .demuxHTTP().to('forward')

  .pipeline('forward')
  .muxHTTP().to('connection')

  .pipeline('connection')
  .connect('localhost:8080')
```

## Code dissection

Besides one _port pipeline_ layout, this time we also added two _sub-pipeline_ layouts called _"forward"_ and _"connection"_.

1. The port pipeline layout listens on port 8000. It has only one filter **demuxHTTP()**. It's similar to **serveHTTP()** that we've been using before for receiving HTTP requests and sending back responses. But instead of handling HTTP requests in a _callback function_, it handles them in a _sub-pipeline_, which is refered to under name _"forward"_ by calling method **to()** right after it.

2. The _sub-pipeline_ layout named _"forward"_ has only one filter **muxHTTP()**. This filter _queues_ up its input message in a shared stream to another _sub-pipeline_ under the name _"connection"_ (as given in method **to()** called after it). It also _dequeues_ a message out of the output from _sub-pipeline "connection"_. The dequeued message would become its own output.

3. The last pipeline layout _"connection"_ is also a _sub-pipeline_. It contains only one filter **connect()** that establishes a TCP connection to remote host _"localhost:8080"_ (given in its construction parameter). After the connection is established, it sends its input data to that host and outputs data received from it.

## Mux and demux

You may ask why we'd need 3 pipeline layouts instead of just a single one like in _"Hello World"_ earlier. This has to do with how a _layer 7_ protocol (or _application layer_ protocol, like HTTP) works, compared to a _layer 4_ protocol (or _transport layer_ protocol, like TCP).

Simply put it, on layer 4 we see continuous _"streams"_ while on layer 7 we see discrete _"messages"_.

For a layer 4 proxy, things are much easier, because connections to downstream clients have a one-on-one relation to upstream servers. For Pipy, that means pipelines handling downstreams have a one-on-one relation to pipelines handling upstreams. In many cases, we can simply proxy a layer 4 stream in one single pipeline that sits between a client and a server, connecting to both of them.

For a layer 7 proxy, things are complicated. A port pipeline handling a downstream connection would receive more than one _messages_. Each of them might go to a different upstream server. Also, when two messages coming from two different downstreams are headed to the same server, you might prefer to send them on a _shared_ upstream connection to that server for the sake of less resource usage.

Therefore, pipelines connected to downstream clients have a many-to-many relationship to those connected to upstream servers. That's why we need separate pipeline layouts to handle downstreams and upstreams differently. In a downstream-oriented pipeline, messages are _"demuxed"_ out of a single transport stream. In an upstream-oriented pipeline, messages are _"muxed"_ into a single transport stream.

### Filter: demuxHTTP()

In our example, a _port pipeline_ gulps incoming data as a sequence of [_Data_](/reference/api/Data) events, each holding a small chunk from the TCP stream. What **demuxHTTP()** does is _"decode"_ and _"demux"_ that TCP stream into separate HTTP messages, enclose each of them between a pair of [_MessageStart_](/reference/api/MessageStart) and [_MessageEnd_](/reference/api/MessageEnd) events, before feeding each of them into a dedicated sub-pipeline for processing.

But that's not the end of the stroy yet. Each sub-pipeline will eventually have a message outputted as its response. Output messages coming out of the end of all sub-pipelines are collected by **demuxHTTP()**. They are then _"encoded"_ and _"muxed"_ into one single TCP stream before going back to the client.

As you can see, although the filter is named _"demuxHTTP"_, but it really performs both _demuxing_ and _muxing_. It demuxes on the requesting path, and muxes on the responding path.

### Filter: muxHTTP()

The opposite to **demuxHTTP()** is **muxHTTP()**. Unlike **demuxHTTP()** spawning multiple sub-pipelines, **muxHTTP()** _shares_ a sub-pipeline with other **muxHTTP()** instances.

The filter accepts an optional parameter `group` for deciding what other **muxHTTP()** instances it shares sub-pipeline with. When two **muxHTTP()** instances from the same pipeline layout have the same `group` value (or return the same value if `group` is a function), they'll share the same sub-pipeline.

By default, `group` is `__inbound`, which is a built-in _context variable_ representing the current downstream connection. So by default, all **muxHTTP()** filters working for the same downstream connection will share one single sub-pipeline.

> Note that this "group sharing" is only between **muxHTTP()** instances coming from the same place in the same pipeline layout. In 2 different pipeline layouts, or 2 different places in one pipeline layout, **muxHTTP()** instances will never share sub-pipelines.

Same as **demuxHTTP()**, although it's named "muxHTTP", but really it also _demuxes_ responses from the end of the shared sub-pipeline as well as _muxing_ requests to it.

### Pipeline topology

In our example, let's say we have one client connection running 2 requests heading for the same server. To handle this, we need up to 4 inter-connected pipelines at runtime:

- 1 downstream-oriented port pipeline connected to the client
- 1 upstream-oriented _"connection"_ sub-pipeline connected to the server
- 2 _"forward"_ sub-pipelines passing 2 requests separately

## Anonymous pipelines

In the script above, we added 2 sub-pipeline layouts and named them "forward" and "connection". These names might help explain the purpose of these pipelines. However, as our script gets longer, giving each sub-pipeline layout a sensible name could turn into a drag. In many cases, it would be more concise and also easier to understand if we just embed a sub-pipeline layout into its parent filter without using a name.

We can do so by changing our code as following:

``` js
pipy()

  .listen(8000)
  .demuxHTTP().to(
    $=>$.muxHTTP().to(
      $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
    )
  )
```

Instead of giving a name to method **to()**, we gave it a function. The function will get a sole argument, of which you can call various methods to add filters to the embedded sub-pipeline layout, just like you do with the [Configuration](/reference/api/Configuration) object returned from [pipy()](/reference/api/pipy). The only difference though, is you can't add pipeline layouts to it. You can only add filters.

> The dollar sign `$` is a valid variable name in PipyJS. We chose this name here just to make sub-pipeline definitions a bit different from normal variables. This is also our recommended naming convention, though you can indeed use any legal variable name you like and the code won't break.

## Test in action

Now let's start the program and `curl` it:

``` sh
curl localhost:8000 -i
```

You will get an error in response:

```
HTTP/1.1 502 Connection Refused
content-length: 0
connection: keep-alive
```

That's because we don't yet have an upstream server to pass requests to.

### Start a second Pipy instance

We have only one single Pipy instance right now, which is already running our proxy program. Now we need to start a second one for the test server.

1. Go back to Web UI homepage, find the `/hello` codebase we've created before, click on it to open it up.

2. Copy the URL appearing in the browser's address bar.

3. Open a second terminal window, type `pipy` and paste after it the URL you just copied from the browser, and then hit Enter.

```sh
pipy http://localhost:6060/repo/hello/
```

Now a new Pipy instance should be up and running. Retry the test we did earlier and see if you'd get the correct answer.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 11
connection: keep-alive

Hi, there!
```

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial, you've learned how Pipy works as a network proxy. You've also seen why we need _sub-pipelines_ and how we define them.

### Takeaways

1. Port pipelines receive data on TCP layer. To handle individual HTTP messages, you need filters like **serveHTTP()** and **demuxHTTP()** to _demux_ messages out of it.

2. The difference between **serveHTTP()** and **demuxHTTP()** is that, the former handles demuxed messages by a _callback function_ while the latter handles them in multiple separate _sub-pipelines_.

3. Before HTTP messages are sent to a remote server, they need to be _muxed_ into one single TCP stream via **muxHTTP()** filters.

4. Use **connect()** to establish an outgoing TCP connection to a remote host.

### What's next?

Our first try for a network proxy is overly-simplified. It really does nothing more than mapping one IP/port to another. For a proxy to be any useful, we need functionalities like routing, load balancing, and so on. Next, we'll be looking at one of the basic tasks a proxy can do: routing.
