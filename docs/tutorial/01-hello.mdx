**Ahoy, world!**

We are all sort of obsessed with "_Hello World_" as programmers, aren't we?
Why don't we dive in now and do just that!

## Start Pipy

First, let's start a live Pipy instance from the command line:

``` sh
pipy
```

When Pipy is up and running, you will see this on your terminal:

```
[info] [codebase] Starting codebase service...
[info] [listener] Listening on port 6060 at ::
```

Now open your favorite web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:6060>.
You will see the builtin _Pipy Administration Web UI_.

## Create a Pipy program

Let's create our first Pipy program:

1. Click **New Codebase**, input `/hello` for the _Codebase name_ in the
   popped up window and then click **Create**. You will be brought to
   a code editor for the newly created codebase.

2. Click the <PlusIcon/> button up above to add a new file. Input `/hello.js`
   for its filename and then click **Create**.

3. Select the newly created file in the _File List_ on left. Click <FlagIcon/>
   button to make the file our program entrance. That means the program
   will be started from this file next time we run it.

4. Now go ahead and write the code for **hello.js**:

``` js
pipy()

.listen(8080)
  .serveHTTP(
    new Message('Hi, there!\n')
  )
```

5. Click <SaveIcon/> button to save your file.

## Code dissection

Take a bit of time examining the code. Here's what's going on:

1. At the very first line, the builtin global function [_pipy()_](/reference/api/pipy)
   is called. It returns a [_Configuration_](/reference/api/Configuration)
   object which we'll be using later on to configure _pipeline layouts_ we need.

2. At line 3, we define a _port pipeline_ that listens on port 8080 by calling method
   [_listen()_](/reference/api/Configuration/listen) of the _Configuration_ object
   returned from _pipy()_ earlier. Method _listen()_ itself returns the same _Configuration_
   object, so we can continually call other methods on it to define more pipelines and
   filters. That's exactly what we are going to do next.

3. At line 4, we define a [_serveHTTP_](/reference/classes/Configuration/serveHTTP) filter 
   on the pipeline we just defined in step 2. The filter takes a [_Message_](/reference/classes/Message)
   object as its construction parameter and will be outputting that same message in
   response to any input message.

All in all the script we have written defined one _pipeline_ containing one _filter_.
To picture it all would be like this:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <SvgHelloPipeline/>
</div>

## Test in action

Time to roll! Click <PlayIcon/> button to run the code. The _Console Window_ would
pop up now and you should see this:

```
[info] [config]
[info] [config] Module /hello.js
[info] [config] ================
[info] [config]
[info] [config]  [Listen on :::8080]
[info] [config]  ----->|
[info] [config]        |
[info] [config]       serveHTTP
[info] [config]        |
[info] [config]  <-----|
[info] [config]  
[info] [listener] Listening on port 8080 at ::
```

Now open up a second terminal window and test it with `curl`:

``` sh
curl localhost:8080
```

You should see the result:

```
Hi, there!
```

Working as expected. Cool!

## Summary

In this first part of our tutorial, you've learned how a Pipy program
is composed. You also familiarized yourself to the builtin _Administration Web UI_
while you created and ran a simple Pipy program.

### Takeaways

* A Pipy program is made of definitions for _pipelines_ and _filters_. It always
  starts off with a call to [_pipy()_](/reference/api/pipy), which gives us
  a [Configuration](/reference/api/Configuration) object, which we call various
  methods on to define our pipelines and filters.

* A _port pipeline_ gets input from reading a network port and writes back whatever
  its last filter outputs.

* A _serveHTTP_ filter can take in HTTP messages as requests and output HTTP messages
  as responses.

### What's next?

Now you've made a simple "_Hello World_" server, but it's barely useful because it always
says the same thing. Next, we'll look into responding with different messages to different
requests.
