Now our little proxy program has routing and load balancing abilities. However, as we were implementing it, we found ourself throwing more and more pipeline layouts into a single source file. The file has been growing rapidly in length. We'd better do some refactoring to the code stucture so that every new function coming in the future can sit in its own file, only optionally hooked up into the system, aka, a _"plugin system"_.

## Design

We have implemented 2 functions in our proxy so far: routing and load balancing. Each of them can be refactored out into a separate plugin. The way we combine these plugins is arrange them in a _chain_. For each request we receive, visit every plugin on the chain and let them decide if they'll do something in response or just pass. Since the plugins are arranged in a determined order, each plugin also gets to decide whether plugins after it should continue to handle a request.

<div style="text-align: center">
  <SvgPluginPipelines/>
</div>

That being said, let's take a look at the plugins we'll create.

### Routing plugin

The routing plugin's job is finding a route for a request. The found route should be saved in a context variable for accessing from other plugins. The plugin will always pass on a request to the next plugin, no matter if a route can be found or not. It only _"marks"_ a request with its route if one can be found.

### Load balancing plugin

The load balancing plugin is responsible for forwarding a request to a server that can handle it. It maps a route found by the routing plugin to a server list and then distribute traffic across those servers. When a route can't be found or a server list isn't configured for a route, it should ignore it and just pass on the request to the next plugin. Otherwise, it should abort the plugin chain with the response returned from the server, since the request is already "handled" in this plugin.

### The default plugin

When a request is passed on by both of the above plugins, which means, either there is no route for it, or no servers can handle the route, a last fallback plugin will take it on. This is the default plugin. It should always respond with a 404 message indicating that the request is not handled by the proxy.

## Routing plugin

The first plugin we do is the routing plugin. Let's create a standalone file for it.

1. Click <PlusIcon/> and input `/plugins/router.js` for the new file's name. Click **Create**.

> No need to create a folder before adding a new file in it. Just put in the
> full pathname including folder names and the folders will be created automatically.

2. Copy the entire content from `/proxy.js` to `/plugins/router.js`.

We delete nearly all code in `/plugins/router.js`, keeping only the call to [URLRouter.find()](/reference/api/algo/URLRouter/find) since that is the meat of our routing plugin. Then we put **handleMessageStart()**, the only filter that's left, under a `.pipeline()` call. Without a parameter to it, [pipeline()](/reference/api/Configuration/pipeline) starts the _entrance_ pipeline layout for a module.

``` js
  ((
    config = JSON.decode(pipy.load('config.json')),
    router = new algo.URLRouter(config.routes),
-   services = Object.fromEntries(
-     Object.entries(config.services).map(
-       ([k, v]) => [
-         k, new algo.RoundRobinLoadBalancer(v)
-       ]
-     )
-   ),

  ) => pipy({
-   _target: undefined,
  })

-   .listen(config.listen)
-   .demuxHTTP().to(
-     $=>$
+     .pipeline()
      .handleMessageStart(
        msg => (
-         ((
            s = router.find(
              msg.head.headers.host,
              msg.head.path,
            )
-         ) => (
-           _target = services[s]?.next?.()
-         ))()
        )
      )
-     .branch(
-       () => Boolean(_target), (
-         $=>$.muxHTTP(() => _target).to(
-           $=>$.connect(() => _target.id)
-         )
-       ), (
-         $=>$.replaceMessage(
-           new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No route')
-         )
-       )
-     )
-   )

  )()
```

We have called [pipeline()](/reference/api/Configuration/pipeline) to define the entrance point to this plugin. That is where the previous plugin connects to this one, if any. Now we should also connect to our next plugin after the routing calculation. We can do so by a joint filter called [chain()](/reference/api/Configuration/chain).

``` js
    .pipeline()
    .handleMessageStart(
      msg => (
        ((
          s = router.find(
            msg.head.headers.host,
            msg.head.path,
          )
        ) => (
          _target = services[s]?.next?.()
        ))()
      )
    )
+   .chain()
```

As you can see, the found route is now saved in an undefined variable `s`. This is certainly not right, but we'll get back to that in a moment.

## Load balancing plugin

The second plugin can be made in the same way as the first one:

- Clone `plugins/balancer.js` from `proxy.js`
- Delete all code apart from the stuff for load balancing
- Put a `.pipeline()` before what's left of the filters as the entrance point to this module.

``` js
  ((
    config = JSON.decode(pipy.load('config.json')),
-   router = new algo.URLRouter(config.routes),
    services = Object.fromEntries(
      Object.entries(config.services).map(
        ([k, v]) => [
          k, new algo.RoundRobinLoadBalancer(v)
        ]
      )
    ),

  ) => pipy({
    _target: undefined,
  })

-   .listen(config.listen)
-   .demuxHTTP().to(
-     $=>$
-     .handleMessageStart(
-       msg => (
-         ((
-           s = router.find(
-             msg.head.headers.host,
-             msg.head.path,
-           )
-         ) => (
-           _target = services[s]?.next?.()
-         ))()
-       )
-     )
+     .pipeline()
      .branch(
        () => Boolean(_target), (
          $=>$.muxHTTP(() => _target).to(
            $=>$.connect(() => _target.id)
          )
        ), (
          $=>$.replaceMessage(
            new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No route')
          )
        )
      )
-   )

  )()
```

As [discussed ealier](/tutorial/07-plugins/#load-balancing-plugin), when a target is not found, this plugin should just pass on the request to the next plugin (the [default plugin](/tutorial/07-plugins/#the-default-plugin) in our case) to continue, instead of responding with a 404 message directly. So we change that to a call to _chain()_.

``` js
    .pipeline()
    .branch(
      () => Boolean(_target), (
        $=>$.muxHTTP(() => _target).to(
          $=>$.connect(() => _target.id)
        )
      ), (
-       $=>$.replaceMessage(
-         new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No route')
-       )
+       $=>$.chain()
      )
    )
```

## The default plugin

The last plugin in our example is pretty simple: just respond with a 404 message. We put it in a new file called `plugins/default.js`.

``` js
pipy()

  .pipeline()
  .replaceMessage(new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No handler'))
```

## Chain of plugins

Now let's put those plugins together into a chain. First, let's prepare the data. In our design, plugins will be activated by using an array in the configuration file. Each element in the array is a plugin's filename.

``` js
    {
    "listen": 8000,
+   "plugin": [
+     "plugins/router.js",
+     "plugins/balancer.js",
+     "plugins/default.js"
+   ],
    "routes": {
        "/hi/*": "service-hi",
        "/echo": "service-echo",
        "/ip/*": "service-tell-ip"
    },
    "services": {
        "service-hi"      : ["127.0.0.1:8080", "127.0.0.1:8082"],
        "service-echo"    : ["127.0.0.1:8081"],
        "service-tell-ip" : ["127.0.0.1:8082"]
    }
    }
```

> Note that the order matters. Plugins coming first have a higher priority over those after, not only they are visited earlier, but also they can decide if plugins after them should continue being visited.

Now let's go back to the entrance file `proxy.js` and delete all code for its functionality, leaving only the _"scaffold"_ for the plugins.

``` js
  ((
    config = JSON.decode(pipy.load('config.json')),
-   router = new algo.URLRouter(config.routes),
-   services = Object.fromEntries(
-     Object.entries(config.services).map(
-       ([k, v]) => [
-         k, new algo.RoundRobinLoadBalancer(v)
-       ]
-     )
-   ),

  ) => pipy({
-   _target: undefined,
  })

    .listen(config.listen)
    .demuxHTTP().to(
      $=>$
-     .handleMessageStart(
-       msg => (
-         ((
-           s = router.find(
-             msg.head.headers.host,
-             msg.head.path,
-           )
-         ) => (
-           _target = services[s]?.next?.()
-         ))()
-       )
-     )
-     .branch(
-       () => Boolean(_target), (
-         $=>$.muxHTTP(() => _target).to(
-           $=>$.connect(() => _target.id)
-         )
-       ), (
-         $=>$.replaceMessage(
-           new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No route')
-         )
-       )
-     )
-   )
+   .chain(config.plugins)

  )()
```

As you can see, we use the same filter [chain()](/reference/api/Configuration/chain) as we do in the plugins when we _"chain"_ into their successors. But here we use it a bit differently. By giving it the plugin list as its parameter, we started the entire _plugin chain_ from this point.

## Export and import

The last thing is fix the undefined variable we have in `router.js`. This variable is supposed to be accessible from `balancer.js` to find a target for the route. Since its value depends on each different request, it should certainly be [context variable](/concepts#context). However, we can't just put it inside the parameter to [pipy()](/reference/api/pipy) as we did before, because that way it'll be only visible to `router.js` itself. We should define it with [_export()_](/reference/api/Configuration/export) in the main framework `proxy.js` so that it can be _"imported"_ from both `router.js` and `balancer.js`.

``` js
  ((
    config = pipy.solve('config.js'),

  ) => pipy()

+   .export('main', {
+     __route: undefined,
+   })

    .listen(config.listen)
    .demuxHTTP().to(
      $=>$.chain(config.plugins)
    )

  )()
```

The first construction parameter to [export()](/reference/api/Configuration/export) is the _namespace_ that other files need to refer to when they import a context variable. It can be any arbitrary name. Here we use "main" because it's related to the main framework our plugins are running under.

> Exported context variables can have any names that are valid JavaScript identifiers. But as a best practice, we recommend that all _exported_ context variable names should be prefixed with 2 underscores, just to make them distinct from context variables that are only locally accessible to a module itself.

Next, we import `__route` into `router.js` and `balancer.js`. Mind that the namespace should match what's in `proxy.js` where `__route` is exported, which should be "main".

For `router.js`, we save the routing calculation result in `__route` after importing it.

``` js
+   .import({
+     __route: 'main',
+   })

    .pipeline()
    .handleMessageStart(
      msg => (
-       s = router.find(
+       __route = router.find(
          msg.head.headers.host,
          msg.head.path,
        )
      )
    )
    .chain()
```


For `balancer.js`, we read back the route that's found in `router.js` and allocate a target for it.

``` js
+   .import({
+     __route: 'main',
+   })

    .pipeline()
    .branch(
-     () => Boolean(_target), (
+     () => Boolean(_target = services[__route]?.next?.()), (
        $=>$
        .muxHTTP(() => _target).to(
          $=>$.connect(() => _target.id)
        )
      ),
      $=>$.chain()
    )
```

That's all we have to do for refactoring our codebase into a simple plugin-based program. You can now do some tests the same way as before.

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial, you've learned how different functions can be isolated in different plugins.

### Takeaways

1. Use [chain()](/reference/api/Configuration/chain) with a list of filenames to start a module chain. Use _chain()_ with no parameters to chain into the next module after the current one.

2. Context variables defined with [pipy()](/reference/api/pipy) are visible only within the current module. To share context variables across different files, use [export()](/reference/api/Configuration/export) and [import()](/reference/api/Configuration/import).
