import SvgRoutingPipelines from './routing-pipelines.svg';

One of the basic tasks a proxy can do is _routing_. For HTTP, routing is usually based on the Host header and the requested URI of a request. In other words, a proxy should be able to map things like "abc.com/api/v1/login" to a certain _target host_ that can handle the request.

## URLRouter

Pipy API provides [URLRouter](/reference/api/algo/URLRouter) for quick mapping from a URL to a value of any type. In our example here, we'd like to map URLs to a _string value_ containing the target address and port.

To define such a mapping, we `new` a _URLRouter_ object, giving it our routing table:

``` js
new algo.URLRouter({
  '/hi/*': 'localhost:8080',
  '/echo': 'localhost:8081',
  '/ip/*': 'localhost:8082',
})
```

We need this router accessible from anywhere in our script, so we should keep it in a _global variable_.

## Global variables

PipyJS is a _functional programming dialect_ of JavaScript. Everything in PipyJS is a _function_. There is no syntax for declaring _global variables_ or _local variables_ in PipyJS. Instead, we use _function arguments_ as local variables. On top of that, when the function is the outermost one that encloses the entire script file, its arguments practically become _"global variables"_.

> For more information on variables in PipyJS, see [Variables](/reference/pjs/1-language/#variables).

So, to have a "globally accessible variable", first, we wrap up our code inside a function and invoke it right in place.

``` js
+ ((
+ ) =>
  pipy()

    .listen(8000)
    .demuxHTTP().to(
      $=>$.muxHTTP().to(
        $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
      )
    )

+ )()
```

> DO NOT FORGET the last pair of parentheses. It tells Pipy to _invoke_ the wrapper function immediately. Without that, it would be a function definition only. The code in it won't actually run.

Next, add an argument named _"router"_ to the argument list at the beginning of the function, with its initial value set to the _URLRouter_ object we have _"newed"_ earlier.

``` js
  ((
+   router = new algo.URLRouter({
+     '/hi/*': 'localhost:8080',
+     '/echo': 'localhost:8081',
+     '/ip/*': 'localhost:8082',
+   })
  ) =>
  pipy()

    .listen(8000)
    .demuxHTTP().to(
      $=>$.muxHTTP().to(
        $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
      )
    )=

  )()
```

## Context variables

In addition to a global URLRouter object, we need a second variable to keep the resulted _target_ from routing calculation. This variable can't be global because its value can be varient for different requests. In other words, the value of the variable depends on the current _context_ when refered to in the script. We call these variables _"context variables"_.

> For more information on _context variables_, see [Context](/intro/concepts#context).

We've seen the built-in context variable `__inbound` in [Part 2](/tutorial/02-echo/#code-dissection-1). This time, we are defining a custom context variable named `_target`. We'll give it an initial value of _undefined_. This is done through the argument given to [pipy()](/reference/api/pipy).

``` js
  ((
    router = new algo.URLRouter({
      '/hi/*': 'localhost:8080',
      '/echo': 'localhost:8081',
      '/ip/*': 'localhost:8082',
    })
  ) =>
- pipy()
+ pipy({
+   _target: undefined,
+ })

    .listen(8000)
    .demuxHTTP().to(
      $=>$.muxHTTP().to(
        $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
      )
    )=

  )()
```

> Context variables can have any names that are valid JavaScript identifiers. But as a best practice, we recommend that all context variable names should be prefixed with a single underline, just to make them distinct from regular variables.

## Routing

Now we have all the variables we need, next thing we do is call [_URLRouter.find()_](/reference/api/algo/URLRouter/find) to work out the value of `_target` based on what's in the request. We can do so in a [handleMessageStart()](/reference/api/Configuration/handleMessageStart) filter right before **muxHTTP()**. It requires only one argument, which is a callback function that we should provide. This callback function will be executed every time a [MessageStart](/reference/api/MessageStart) event passes by. It then receives that **MessageStart** object as its sole argument, from which we obtain information about the request, calculate its routing, and leave the result in `_target`.

``` js
  ((
    router = new algo.URLRouter({
      '/hi/*': 'localhost:8080',
      '/echo': 'localhost:8081',
      '/ip/*': 'localhost:8082',
    })
  ) =>
  pipy({
    _target: undefined,
  })

    .listen(8000)
    .demuxHTTP().to(
      $=>$
+     .handleMessageStart(
+       msg => (
+         _target = router.find(
+           msg.head.headers.host,
+           msg.head.path,
+         )
+       )
+     )
      .muxHTTP().to(
        $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
      )
    )

  )()
```

### Filter: connect

Now we've worked out `_target`, but we are still connecting to a fixed target _"localhost:8080"_. We should change that to `_target` accordingly, right?

``` js
      .muxHTTP().to(
-       $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
+       $=>$.connect(_target) // WRONG!!!
      )
```

If you run this code, however, you will get an error:

```
[ERR] [pjs] File /proxy.js:
[ERR] [pjs] Line 24:  $=>$.connect(_target)
[ERR] [pjs]                        ^
[ERR] [pjs] Error: unresolved identifier
```

This is because, a context variable needs a context. They are only alive when a context is created for running some pipelines. When we run the above code, however, we are in _"configure time"_, where we only _define_ pipeline layouts without _spawning_ any pipelines just yet. Since there are no incoming I/O events to handle, no pipelines are created, no contexts are needed, so no context variables exist. 

How do we get around this? The same way as in [Part 2](/tutorial/02-echo/) where we made a filter parameter _dynamic_: just wrap it in a **function** that returns
a dynamic value at runtime.

``` js
      .muxHTTP().to(
-       $=>$.connect(_target) // WRONG!!!
+       $=>$.connect(() => _target)
      )
```

Now `() => _target` is only a _function definition_ when we run the code at _configure time_. It's legit at the moment because `_target` is not evaluated yet. It'll only be evaluated _at runtime_ when the pipeline receives an input. At that point, the code is being executed in a certain context, where `_target` will have a set value from the previous **handleMessageStart()** callback.

## Branching

But wait, what if a target can't be found? If so, `_target` would be `undefined`, and we'd have nowhere to pass on the request to. We should then, in this situation, direct that request to a different path where _"404 Not Found"_ is sent back in response. This is where we need a **branch()**.

### Filter: branch

Filter [branch()](/reference/api/Configuration/branch) accepts one or more pairs of parameters. In each pair, a callback function comes first for the condition when a branch should be selected, followed by a sub-pipeline layout for the branch. The last pair can have its condition omitted, which means the last default branch.

With that, we wrap up **muxHTTP()** in a **branch()** so that events only go to it when `_target` is found:

``` js
    .listen(8000)
    .demuxHTTP().to(
      $=>$
      .handleMessageStart(
        msg => (
          _target = router.find(
            msg.head.headers.host,
            msg.head.path,
          )
        )
      )
+     .branch(
+       () => Boolean(_target), (
+         $=>$
          .muxHTTP().to(
            $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
          )
+       )
+     )
    )
```

> The condition could be as simple as `() => _target` because **branch()** takes a truthy return value as "yes" and falsy as "no". But we explicitly coerce `_target` to a boolean value just for clarity.

### Filter: replaceMessage

The last piece to the puzzle is the _"infamous 404 page"_. We will handle that by a sub-pipeline in the fallback branch to **branch()**.

Could we do it with **serveHTTP()**, as we did in [Part 1](/tutorial/01-hello/)? The answer is no, unfortunately. **serveHTTP()** expects its input to be a raw TCP stream so that it can do its job: _"deframing"_ HTTP messages out of a TCP stream. But here, deframing has been done already in **demuxHTTP()**. You can't deframe a TCP stream twice.

Since the stream fed to our new "404" sub-pipeline has already been transformed from a _byte stream_ to a _message_, that is, from layer 4 (transport layer) to layer 7 (application layer), we can simply "replace" the message on layer 7 with a new "404" message so that the sub-pipeline would output a "404" response in the end.

``` js
      .branch(
        () => Boolean(_target), (
          $=>$.muxHTTP().to(
            $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
          )
+       ), (
+         $=>$.replaceMessage(
+           new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No route')
+         )
        )
      )
```

> You can think of **serveHTTP()** as a combination of a **demuxHTTP()** plus a **replaceMessage()**, where **replaceMessage()** holds the callback handler as in **serveHTTP()** to return a response.
> So the following code:
> ``` js
> serveHTTP(req => makeResponse(req))
> ```
> is equivalent to:
> ``` js
> demuxHTTP().to($=>$.replaceMessage(req => makeResponse(req)))
> ```

Now you might wonder where the output from this "404" sub-pipeline goes next. How does it make it to the client?

### Joint filters

Pipy pipelines are one-way paths. Events stream in to its first filter, out from its last filter. For a _port pipeline_, requests from a client are its input, while responses back to the client are its output. Usually (not always though), this is also true for a sub-pipeline, where its input is a request and its output is a response.

When a _joint filter_ like **branch()** links to a sub-pipeilne, the input to the joint filter goes to the input of the sub-pipeline, and the output from that sub-pipeline usually goes back to the joint filter and becomes the filter's output also. In our example, what **replaceMessage()** outputs becomes **branch()**'s output too. It then in turn goes back to **demuxHTTP()**, and eventually, back to the port pipeline's output as response.

That being said, when a request can't be routed and has to go down the "404" branch, its entire traveling path would be like this:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <SvgRoutingPipelines/>
</div>

For more about sub-pipelines and joint filters, see [Sub-pipeline](/intro/concepts/#sub-pipeline).

## Connection Sharing Problem

Now if you test the code, it seems working well at first:

``` sh
$ curl localhost:8000/hi
Hi, there!
$ curl localhost:8000/ip
You are requesting /ip from 127.0.0.1
$ curl localhost:8000/bad
No route
```

But if we try to send 2 requests targeting different servers on one single client connection, we'll get:

``` sh
$ curl localhost:8000/hi localhost:8000/ip
Hi, there!
Hi, there!
$ curl localhost:8000/ip localhost:8000/hi
You are requesting /ip from 127.0.0.1
You are requesting /hi from 127.0.0.1
```

Both requests were directed to the same server as the first request in that client connection. What gives?

This is because the upstream connection was established by **connect()** in a sub-pipeline created from **muxHTTP()**, and the connection is established only once for every sub-pipeline it creates. That means, there's a one-on-one relationship bewteen a server connection and a sub-pipeline from **muxHTTP()**. As explained in [Filter: muxHTTP](/tutorial/03-proxy/#filter-muxhttp) from the last chapter, multiple **muxHTTP()** instances share, by default, the same sub-pipeline for a particular _Inbound_ (or in our case, a particular connection from _curl_ client). Once the outbound connection is up, it won't change any more until the next inbound connection leads **muxHTTP()** to a different sub-pipeline. Even when each request has a different `_target` value to it, the variable is only used once as the connection is established. After that, its value is no longer relevant. It won't lead to a reconnection in the **connect()** filter.

To solve this problem, we change the strategy how **muxHTTP()** instances share sub-pipelines by giving it the variable `_target` for the _group sharing_ criterion, so that sub-pipelines will only be shared by requests targetting to the same server, regardless of what client connection.

``` js
      .branch(
        () => Boolean(_target), (
-         $=>$.muxHTTP().to(
+         $=>$.muxHTTP(() => _target).to(
            $=>$.connect('localhost:8080')
          )
        ), (
          $=>$.replaceMessage(
            new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No route')
          )
        )
      )
```

This is not the best strategy for HTTP/1 though, as when more than one client requests have to share the same server connection, they'll be queued up and served only one at a time. There would be no concurrency. But we'll leave the solution to that problem for the next topic in this tutorial.

## Test in action

Now run this program and do the failed test again.

``` sh
$ curl localhost:8000/hi localhost:8000/ip
Hi, there!
You are requesting /ip from 127.0.0.1
```

Problem solved!

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial, you've learned how to implement a simple routing proxy. You've also learned about defining and using variables, as well as a few more filters: **branch()**, **handleMessageStart()** and **replaceMessage()**.

### Takeaways

1. Use [algo.URLRouter](/reference/api/algo/URLRouter) for a routing table that maps a URL-like path to a value of any type, based on which a simple routing proxy can be implemented.

2. By using a **branch()** filter, a sub-pipeline can be selectively created for handling a stream. It resembles _if_ or _switch_ statements in programming languages, where a control flow can have conditional branches.

3. Use **replaceMessage()** to turn a request message into a response message on layer 7. The combination of **demuxHTTP()** and **replaceMessage()** can be an equivalent to **serveHTTP()**.

### What's next?

Another basic functionality a proxy should provide is _load balancing_. We'll look into that next.
