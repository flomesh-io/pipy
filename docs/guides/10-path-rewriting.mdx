title: "Part 10: Path rewriting"
---

## Problem

Suppose you want to redirect traffic based on the URL and you configure a Pipy proxy route to say `"/ip/*"` and have it route to some target. Assume target is running a simple service which just return the path and client IP. Sending a request as is to `localhost:8000/ip/a`ï¼Œyou will receive response like this:

```shell
curl localhost:8000/ip/a
You are requesting /ip/a from ::ffff:127.0.0.1

curl localhost:8000/ip
You are requesting /ip from ::ffff:127.0.0.1
```

But what we expect or our desired outcome is:

```
You are requesting /a from ::ffff:127.0.0.1
```

Because prefix `/ip` in the pattern `/ip/*` represents ip service listening on configured port and we are expecting that all requests starting with `/ip/` should be redirected to specific target for handling. Or there maybe cases where you want to forward request to different path.
So we need a functionality to have Pipy help us do the **rewriting** of path received, and path rewriting is one of the important characteristics of any proxy.

## RegExp

Suppose we want path starting with `/ip/` should be replaced with `/`. *replace(searchFor, replaceWith)* function of JavaScript `String` can take its first argument either as a string or a `regex` pattern.

```js
new RegExp('^/ip/?')
```

## Extended Routing Configuration

Add *rewrite* fields by abstracting services from routing tables and encapsulating them as objects

```js
{
  "routes": {
    "/hi/*": { "service": "service-hi" },
    "/echo": { "service": "service-echo" },
    "/ip/*": { "service": "service-tell-ip", "rewrite": ["^/ip/?", "/"] }
  }
}
```

Also adjust initialization of the global variable *_router* by converting the first value of the *rewrite* array into a `RegExp` object for the service you need to rewrite. Add a new global variable *_route* to receive the return value of the routing decision.

```js
pipy({
  _router: new algo.URLRouter(
    Object.fromEntries(
      Object.entries(config.routes).map(
        ([k, v]) => [
          k,
          {
            ...v,
            rewrite: v.rewrite ? [
              new RegExp(v.rewrite[0]),
              v.rewrite[1],
            ] : undefined,
          }
        ]
      )
    )
  ),

  _route: null,
})
```

> We are using Javsacript **spread operator** `...` here to expand in place the service object and re-copying `rewrite` field. 

## Rewriting Path

We can use `__router.find()` to find the requested route by passing in the host and path header information, once we get hold of valid `_route` result, we can retrieve the linked service into ``__serviceID` variable and perform path rewrite for objects where we have configured `rewrite` field and update the *path* field of request header with rewritten path.

```js
.pipeline('request')
  .handleMessageStart(
    msg => (
      _route = _router.find(
        msg.head.headers.host,
        msg.head.path,
      ),
      _route && (
        __serviceID = _route.service,
        _route.rewrite && (
          msg.head.path = msg.head.path.replace(
            _route.rewrite[0],
            _route.rewrite[1],
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
```

## Test in action

Let's use the same test we used in the start of this tutorial:

```shell
curl localhost:8000/ip/a
You are requesting /a from ::ffff:127.0.0.1

curl localhost:8000/ip
You are requesting / from ::ffff:127.0.0.1
```

## Summary

In this tutorial we have used JavaScript regular expressions and string manipulation to implement the common gateway path rewriting functionality.

### Takeaways

* Pipy class `RegExp` is used for regular expressions search and/or subtitution..
* Using spread operator `...` instead of enumeration to create literal objects makes it easier to extend the objects later.

### What's next?

We continue to add new capabilities to our proxy **access logging**, and will introduce and expand our knowledge of using Pipy other **filters**.
