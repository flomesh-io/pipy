Now that we have a working proxy with basic routing and 404 responses.
However, we find ourself throwing more and more pipelines into the source file
and it's growing rapidly as we add more features to it. So before we
move on to the next proxy feature, we better do some refactoring to the
code stucture so every newly added feature in the future can be in its own file,
only optionally hooked up into the system, aka "_plugins_".

## Router plugin

The main feature of our proxy right now is _routing_. Code for routing makes
up most of the content in `/proxy.js`. So we can base on that to form the
code for our first plugin "_router_".

1. Click <PlusIcon/> button and input `/plugins/router.js` for the new file's name.
   Click **Create**.

> No need to create a folder before adding a new file. Just put in the
> full pathname including folder names and they will be created automatically.

2. Copy the entire content from `/proxy.js` to `/plugins/router.js`.

Inside `/plugins/router.js`, the routing logic only kicks in at pipeline "_request_",
right after _demuxHTTP()_. So we can remove _demuxHTTP()_ with its whole pipeline out of here,
leaving it to the _main script_ `/proxy.js` and linking from there to
"_request_" pipeline here in a while.

``` js
- .listen(8000)
-   .demuxHTTP('request')

  .pipeline('request')
    .handleMessageStart(
      msg => (
        _target = _router.find(
          msg.head.headers.host,
          msg.head.path,
        )
      )
    )
    .link(
      'forward', () => Boolean(_target),
      '404'
    )
```

The "404" logic can also be in a stand-alone plugin, where it acts as the
"_default_" handler when a request has no other handlers in all other plugins.
So we just delete this "404" pipeline right now and redo it in a separate plugin later.

``` js
  .pipeline('connection')
    .connect(
      () => _target
    )

- .pipeline('404')
-   .replaceMessage(
-     new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No route')
-   )
```

Since we have no pipeline "_404_" here any more, we should change the
reference to it in _link()_ accordingly.

``` js
    .link(
      'forward', () => Boolean(_target),
-     '404'
+      ''
    )
```

Changing a pipeline name in _link()_ to empty means linking to nothing.
In this case, everything coming along to _link()_ will just go down without
any changes (only when `_target` is falsy), as if _link()_ wasn't there.

## Default plugin

Now let's create the "_default_" plugin mentioned above.

Create a file named `/plugins/default.js` and write down its code:

``` js
pipy()

.pipeline('request')
  .replaceMessage(
    new Message({ status: 404 }, 'No handler')
  )
```

As you can see, this one is easy. It has only one sub-pipeline, also named "_request_".
It does exactly the same thing as our good old "_404_" pipeline, only changing
the message from "_No route_" to "_No handler_".

## Chain of plugins

Now we go back to the main script `/proxy.js`. Since we've moved almost all code
to the plugins, we're left with only _demuxHTTP()_ and an empty "_request_" pipeline.

``` js
pipy()

.listen(8000)
  .demuxHTTP('request')

.pipeline('request')
```

In this empty "_request_" pipeline, we chain the other two "_request_" pipelines together
from the plugins. We do this with [_use()_](/reference/api/Configuration/use),
giving it the filenames where the pipelines reside, as well as the name under which
pipelines can be found.

``` js
  .pipeline('request')
+   .use(
+     [
+       'plugins/router.js',
+       'plugins/default.js',
+     ],
+     'request',
+     'response',
+   )
```

You may notice that besides "_request_", we provided a second pipeline name "_response_".
This is the name of pipelines we'll run streams through after all "_request_" pipelines,
but in reversed order in the plugin list.

Here's what the "_plugin chain_" made by _use()_ looks like:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <SvgPluginPipelines/>
</div>

We haven't defined "_response_" pipelines in the plugins yet. No worries.
If a pipeline name is not found in a plugin, the chain will simply skip over it.

## Turn down a request

Now we have our plugins chained together. There's a problem though.
Every incoming request goes through the same `router.js` and `default.js`,
even when it's already been proxied out to the upstream server in `router.js`
and come back as a response. After `default.js`, they are all
"_replaced_" by a "_404 No handler_".

We solve this problem by using a custom global variable that indicates
whether a request is handled or not. When a request has been proxied in `router.js`,
the variable is set to `true`, telling _use()_ to stop going further up the chain
but go down it. We name the variable `__turnDown`.

We give the variable to _use()_ in its last construction parameter.
Remember that this is a dynamic value, we should wrap it in a function.

``` js
  .pipeline('request')
    .use(
      [
        'plugins/router.js',
        'plugins/default.js',
      ],
      'request',
      'response',
+     () => __turnDown,
    )
```

### Export and import

Next, we define the global variable. We can't define it the way we used to though,
because that way it'll only be visible in `proxy.js` but not in `router.js`.

We define it with [_export()_](/reference/api/Configuration/export) in `proxy.js`
so that it can be "_imported_" from other files. It has an initial value of `false`.

``` js
  pipy()

+ .export('proxy', {
+   __turnDown: false,
+ })
```

The first construction parameter to _export()_ is the _namespace_ where
other files import from. It can be any arbitrary name.
Here we use "_proxy_" because it's meaningful.

Next, we import this variable from `router.js` and set it to `true`
when a route is found.

``` js
+ .import({
+   __turnDown: 'proxy',
+ })

  .pipeline('request')
    .handleMessageStart(
      msg => (
        _target = _router.find(
          msg.head.headers.host,
          msg.head.path,
-       )
+       ),
+       _target && (__turnDown = true)
      )
    )
    .link(
      'forward', () => Boolean(_target),
      ''
    )
```

Mind that the namespace should match what's in `proxy.js`
where `__turnDown` is exported, which is "_proxy_".

## Test in action

We haven't added any new features this time.
It should work just like last time.

``` sh
$ curl localhost:8000/hi
Hi, there!
$ curl localhost:8000/ip
You are requesting /ip from ::ffff:127.0.0.1
$ curl localhost:8000/echo -d 'hello'
hello
$ curl localhost:8000/bad/path
No handler
```

## Summary

In this part of tutorial, you've learned how different features
can be isolated in different plugins. This has made a solid foundation
for the further expansion of our proxy's feature set.

### Takeaways

1. Use [_use()_](/reference/api/Configuration/use) to link to pipelines
   defined in other files and form a _plugin chain_. It is the key to
   an extendable plugin architecture.

2. Global variables defined with [_pipy()_](/reference/api/pipy)
   are visible only within its definition file. To shared global variables
   across different files, use [_export()_](/reference/api/Configuration/export)
   and [_import()_](/reference/api/Configuration/import).

### What's next?

We now have a fully functioning routing proxy with a sleek plugin system,
but it's still not good enough. We have lots of parameters all over the code,
such as the port we listen on and the routing table. It would be more nice and tidy to
have all these parameters in a separate "_configuration_" file.
That's what we are going to do next.
