Pipy is a cloud-native high-performance network traffic processor. Written
in C++, built on top of Asio asynchronous I/O library, Pipy is extremely
lightweight and fast, making it one of the best choices for service mesh sidecars.

With builtin JavaScript support, thanks to QuickJS, Pipy is highly
customizable and also predictable in performance with no garbage collection
overhead seen in other scriptable counterparts.

At its core, Pipy has a modular design with many small reusable modules
that can be chained together to make a pipeline, through which network data
flow and get processed on the way. The way Pipy is designed makes it versatile
enough for not only sidecars but also other use cases involving intermediate
message processing between network nodes.
