title: "Quick Start"
---

For learning, development, or debugging purposes it's recommended to proceed with the local installation (either build from sources or download pre-built release for your specific OS) of Pipy as it comes with admin web console along with documentation and tutorials.

Once installed locally, running `pipy` without any arguments starts the admin console on port `6060` and it can be configured to listen on the different port via `--admin-port=` argument.

To easily install Pipy on macOS, WSL you can use Homebrew.

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew tap flomesh-io/pipy
$ brew install pipy
```

### Upgrade

When a new Pipy version is released you can upgrade your system using:

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade pipy
```

### Run via CLI

To start a Pipy proxy, run `pipy` with a PipyJS script file, for example, the script
in `tutorial/01-hello/main.js` if you need a simple echo server that responds with the same message
body as in every incoming request:

```sh
$ pipy tutorial/01-hello/main.js
```

Alternatively, while developing and debugging, one can start Pipy with a builtin web UI:

```sh
$ pipy tutorial/01-hello/main.js --admin-port=6060
```

### Run via Docker

Annother approach is running with Docker. Note: this image has no builtin admin console.

```sh
docker run --rm -v $PWD/tutorial:/tutorial -p 8080:8080 flomesh/pipy-pjs:latest pipy /tutorial/01-hello/main.js
```

### Show Command-Line Options

```sh
$ pipy --help
```

### List Builtin Filters and Their Parameters

Open the browser of your choice, point to [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060). You will now see the Admin UI where you can start exploring the documentation and playing around with the tutorial codebases.

You'll find built-in filters and help information in [http://localhost:6060/docs/reference/api/Configuration](http://localhost:6060/docs/reference/api/Configuration).
